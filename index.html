			<p>Hi, I am Nick. I have a degree in Business Administration - Marketing from Augustana College where I played 4 years of varsity football. After graduation, I went to China for 4 months to teach English to high school students and play semi-pro football for 2 different teams.</p>

			<p>After spending 4 months in China, I decided it was time to come back and get into my marketing career. I worked a couple customer service and sales focused part time jobs while looking for a full time position. In June of 2016 I was fortunate enough to find such a position as a Marketing Coordinator at Guaranteed Rate where I was until 2018. While at GR, I had taken on many different roles as a trainer, database expert, and jack of all trades. Throughout my time at GR, I realized that I wanted to transition out of marketing and into web development.</p>

			<p>Right after graduating from my bootcamp, I joined a consulting company in the Quad Cities and worked on a React project for a mulitnational agricultural business within a large team in an agile environment. Currently, I am working as a Front-End Developer working mainly in React.</p>

			<p>To build on that, I have an interest in learning the follow languages and frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Python, and Django+. In addition to this, I would like to dive deep into the hardware end of technology so I can get a more complete picture of the synchronous relationship between software and hardware. In an effort to continue learning, I have purchased a Udemy course in C# and Python/Django and am currently planning on taking the Google sponosored IT Support Certification program through Coursera.</p>
